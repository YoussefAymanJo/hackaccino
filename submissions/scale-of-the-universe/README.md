## How did you build this?

How: Started with HTML, then added a style tag containing css to to style the page making it ready for three.js implementation. Then used an importmap script to import three.js scripts using the jsDelivr CDN. Then I set logarithmicDepthBuffer to true in the WebGL renderer so it was the scale was logarithmic. Lastly, I added smaller additions like bloom and textures.
